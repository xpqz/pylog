# Stage 0: Core Shapes & Explicit Stacks - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully eliminated Python recursion from execution by implementing an explicit goal stack and choicepoint system. This stage establishes the core execution model that has proven stable through extensive testing.

## Status: COMPLETE
- All 4003 unit tests passing
- No Python recursion in implementation
- Property tests validated with 100+ random cases
- Stress tests complete without errors
- Trail stamp bug fixed (separated bind vs structural changes)
- List reification properly flattens nested structures

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. Clause Representation (`prolog/ast/clauses.py`) ✅
- Clause dataclass with frozen immutability
- Program class with efficient clause lookup
- ClauseCursor for iteration through matching clauses
- Proper handling of facts vs rules

### 2. Goal Stack (`prolog/engine/runtime.py`) ✅
- Goal dataclass with type dispatch
- GoalStack with push/pop/snapshot/restore
- Proper body goal ordering (reversed for left-to-right execution)
- Support for control constructs (conjunction, disjunction, cut)

### 3. Choicepoint System (`prolog/engine/choicepoint.py`) ✅
- Choicepoint dataclass with all necessary state
- ChoiceStack with cut_to support
- Proper cut barrier tracking
- Pre-goal snapshot semantics

### 4. Variable Renaming (`prolog/engine/rename.py`) ✅
- VarRenamer class for fresh variable generation
- Consistent mapping within single clause
- No variable sharing between clause uses
- Handles nested structures and lists properly

### 5. Trail System (`prolog/engine/runtime.py`) ✅
- Trail class with write stamp optimization
- Separate tracking for bind vs structural changes (parent/rank)
- Proper unwinding on backtrack
- TrailAdapter for compatibility with unify module

### 6. Main Engine (`prolog/engine/engine.py`) ✅
- Iterative execution loop (no Python recursion)
- Proper backtracking with state restoration
- Solution recording and reification
- Support for trace mode and debugging

### 7. Builtins Implemented ✅
- `true/0` - always succeeds
- `fail/0` - always fails
- `!/0` - cut (prunes choicepoints)
- `call/1` - meta-call with full dereferencing
- `=/2` - unification
- `\\=/2` - negated unification
- `var/1`, `nonvar/1` - variable tests
- `atom/1`, `integer/1` - type tests
- `is/2` - arithmetic evaluation
- Comparison operators: `</2`, `>/2`, `=</2`, `>=/2`, `=:=/2`, `=\\=/2`

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Trail Stamps Contract
- One write per (kind, varid, stamp) triple
- Kinds: 'bind', 'parent', 'rank', 'attr', 'domain'
- next_stamp() only called when creating real choicepoints
- Ensures proper backtracking of all changes

### List Reification Policy  
- Nested PrologList structures are flattened during reification
- Improper lists (with non-list tails) retain their tail
- Ensures output matches standard Prolog behavior

### Call/1 Transparency
- Meta-call pushes goal directly without frame or choicepoint
- Maintains proper call/exit port pairing
- Full dereferencing of variable chains

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests ✅
- 4003 tests passing
- Comprehensive coverage of all components
- Edge cases and error conditions tested

### Integration Tests ✅
- Deep recursion (1000+ levels)
- Complex backtracking scenarios
- Cut in various positions
- Multi-solution queries

### Property Tests ✅
- Solution completeness
- No duplicate solutions
- Correct depth-first, left-to-right order
- State isolation between branches
- Deterministic behavior

### Stress Tests ✅
- 10000+ clause databases
- 1000+ pending goals
- Deep nesting and many choicepoints
- Memory stability verified

## Performance Optimizations

- Trail write stamps prevent redundant trailing
- Path compression only during mutation (trailed)
- Clause indexing by functor/arity
- Efficient snapshot/restore using tuples
- Iterative algorithms avoid stack overflow

## Known Limitations (Acceptable for Stage 0)

- No operator support (Stage 1.5)
- Limited ISO builtins (Stage 1)
- No indexing beyond functor/arity (Stage 2)
- No attributed variables (Stage 4)
- No CLP(FD) (Stage 5+)

## Migration Notes for Next Stages

The following interfaces are stable and will survive:
- Term representation (Atom, Int, Var, Struct, List)
- Store and Trail APIs
- Engine hooks for extensions
- Clause and Program structures

When adding new features:
- Use Goal.type dispatch for new control constructs
- Add builtins via registration system
- Extend trail entries for new mutation types
- Maintain iterative execution (no recursion)

## Conclusion

Stage 0 successfully establishes a solid foundation for the PyLog Prolog interpreter. The explicit stack architecture eliminates Python recursion limits while maintaining clean separation of concerns. All tests pass, performance is acceptable, and the codebase is ready for Stage 1 enhancements.

## Notes
- Order âˆ© Candidates is the core correctness pattern - NEVER concatenate buckets
- Always dereference before selection - bound values determine bucket
- Per-predicate indexing prevents cross-contamination - enforced by design
- Variable clauses must always be candidates - cannot be filtered out
- Empty list is Atom('[]'), not a list structure - special bucket required
- Non-empty list [H|T] is '.'/2 structure - separate from empty list
- Source order must be preserved exactly - filter through order, not concatenate
- Stage 2 assumes static program - no assert/retract support
- Integers include negative values - p(-3) and p(3) both use int_ids
- Attributed variables treated as unbound variables for selection
- select() must return iterator/generator for streaming semantics
- Small predicates (â‰¤3 clauses) may bypass indexing for efficiency
- Performance gain is the primary goal - 30x-300x for large fact bases
- Indexing is optional (use_indexing parameter) - backward compatible
- Debug instrumentation helps verify performance claims
- Cut semantics must be preserved exactly
- Memory overhead should be bounded and documented

# Catch/Throw Test Suite Summary

## Test Coverage Overview

The comprehensive test suite (`prolog/tests/unit/test_catch_throw_comprehensive.py`) contains **34 tests** covering all aspects of catch/throw functionality.

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ **22 tests PASS** - Basic functionality works
- ‚ùå **11 tests XFAIL** - Known issues documented
- ‚ú® **1 test XPASS** - Unexpectedly passing (unification failure propagation)

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Catch/Throw (5/5 PASS) ‚úÖ
- Simple catch and throw
- Compound term throwing/catching
- Variable catchers (catch-all)
- Normal execution without throw
- Uncaught exceptions raise PrologThrow

### 2. State Restoration (0/4 PASS) ‚ùå
All tests XFAIL - Critical bug identified:
- `test_bindings_undone_after_catch` - Bindings not restored
- `test_complex_unification_undone` - Complex state not restored
- `test_list_unification_restoration` - List structure issues
- `test_variable_aliasing_restoration` - Aliasing not restored

**Root Cause**: Trail var-stamps not cleared when rewinding to older stamp window

### 3. Ball Unification (4/4 PASS) ‚úÖ
- Ball binds catcher variables ‚úÖ
- Non-matching catcher propagates ‚úÖ (XPASS - base Engine works correctly)
- Partial unification failure ‚úÖ
- Catcher with existing bindings ‚úÖ

**Note**: The XPASS indicates base Engine already handles propagation correctly (ISO compliant). DevEngine intentionally converts to failure for developer convenience.

### 4. Nested Catches (4/4 PASS) ‚úÖ
- Inner catch handles first ‚úÖ
- Outer catch handles unmatched ‚úÖ
- Throw from recovery goal ‚úÖ
- Deeply nested catches ‚úÖ

### 5. Cut Interaction (1/3 PASS) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `test_cut_in_catch_goal` - XFAIL (cut barrier not established)
- `test_catch_creates_cut_barrier` - XFAIL (cut escapes catch)
- `test_cut_in_recovery_goal` - PASS ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Catch doesn't establish proper cut barrier

### 6. Backtracking Behavior (2/3 PASS) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Backtrack through catch (no throw) ‚úÖ
- No backtrack after catch handles ‚úÖ
- Catch at choice points - XFAIL (CP restoration assertion)

### 7. Streaming Compatibility (0/2 PASS) ‚ùå
Both tests XFAIL:
- `test_catch_with_streaming_enabled` - Streaming state lost
- `test_streaming_cursor_restoration` - Cursor not restored

**Issue**: StreamingClauseCursor state not saved in catch CP

### 8. Edge Cases (4/7 PASS) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Throw with unbound variable ‚úÖ
- Recursive predicates - XFAIL (CP restoration with recursion)
- Catch with failing recovery ‚úÖ
- Multiple throws same goal ‚úÖ

### 9. Tracing/Instrumentation (2/2 PASS) ‚úÖ
- Catch emits trace events ‚úÖ
- CATCH choicepoint creation ‚úÖ

### 10. ISO Compliance (2/3 PASS) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ISO example 1 ‚úÖ
- ISO example 2 ‚úÖ
- Ball copy semantics - XFAIL (ball not properly copied)

## Critical Issues Identified

### Priority 1: State Restoration üî¥
**4 tests failing**
- Variable bindings not properly undone
- Trail var-stamps causing "already trailed" false positives
- Fix: Clear `_var_stamps` in `Trail.set_current_stamp()`

### Priority 2: Cut Barriers üü†
**2 tests failing**
- Cuts can escape catch scope
- No barrier established by catch
- Fix: Add frame with cut_barrier or make CATCH CP a barrier

### Priority 3: Streaming Support üü°
**2 tests failing**
- Cursor state lost during exception
- Fix: Save/restore cursor state in CATCH CP payload

### Priority 4: Complex Edge Cases üü°
**3 tests failing**
- Recursive catch/throw patterns
- Ball copy semantics
- CP restoration assertions

## Test Design Highlights

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive coverage** - All major aspects tested
2. **Clear categorization** - Tests grouped by functionality
3. **ISO compliance tests** - Validates against standard
4. **Tracer integration** - Verifies debugging support
5. **Edge case coverage** - Unusual scenarios tested

### Test Patterns Used
- Simple predicates for basic functionality
- Recursive predicates for complex control flow
- Compound terms for unification testing
- Multiple choice points for backtracking
- Nested structures for state management

## Next Steps

1. **Fix state restoration** - Highest priority, breaks basic semantics
2. **Add cut barriers** - Important for control flow isolation
3. **Implement two-phase unification** - Clean trial matching
4. **Fix streaming compatibility** - Performance feature support
5. **Validate against SWI-Prolog** - Ensure ISO compliance

## Notes

- The XPASS test (non-matching catcher propagation) confirms base Engine handles this correctly (ISO compliant). DevEngine intentionally converts uncaught throws to failures for developer convenience.
- Several tests had to be rewritten to avoid parser limitations (no inline conjunctions in some contexts).
- The test suite is designed to be run both before and after fixes to track progress.
- Tests use base `Engine` by default for ISO compliance validation.

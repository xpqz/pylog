This folder contains everything necessary for running
a set of tests on an ISO-Prolog system.

Files:

        harness.pl      the test harness, i.e. the code that performs
                        the testing (written in pure ISO-Prolog)

        auxiliaries.pl  auxiliary predicates used by the tests themselves
                        (not pure ISO-Prolog, may require editing for
                        your specific Prolog system)

        iso.tst         the actual test patterns

        <other files>   accessed by the tests (do not edit)


Running the tests:

1. Edit auxiliaries.pl, adapting the definitions to your system
2. Run your Prolog system
3. Compile/load harness.pl and auxiliaries.pl
4. Run the query test('iso.tst').


Adding tests:

See harness.pl for the syntax of test patterns.
The given tests in iso.tst focus on error handling and corner cases
of functionality.  More basic functionality test should be added.

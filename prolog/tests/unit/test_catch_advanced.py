"""Tests for advanced catch/3 semantics.

Tests proper choicepoint management, backtracking behavior, and state restoration
for exception handling in Stage 1.

These tests verify:
- Choicepoint preservation/removal at throw boundaries
- Backtracking through catch on success vs caught exception
- Trail unwinding to proper catch points
- Nested catch/throw interactions

"""Variable liveness analysis for WAM compilation.

Classifies variables as temporary (X) or permanent (Y) based on lifetime:
- Temporary: Dies before next call, single occurrence
- Permanent: Lives across calls, multiple occurrences

The classification determines register allocation:
- X registers: Temporary variables (not preserved across calls)
- Y registers: Permanent variables (preserved in environment frame)

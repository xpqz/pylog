# Errors

Common issues:

- Missing full stop `.` at end of goal or clause.
- Unknown operator or term syntax. Check operators and lists.
- Non‑linear CLP(FD) term like `X*Y`. Only linear arithmetic is supported.
- Empty domain after posting constraints. Relax constraints or domains.

Use smaller examples to isolate errors and add constraints step by step.

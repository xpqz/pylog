# PyLog User Guide

PyLog is a Prolog interpreter written in Python. It supports a practical subset of ISO Prolog and adds finiteâ€‘domain constraint solving (CLP(FD)).

This guide helps you:

- run goals in the REPL
- write facts and rules
- model and solve problems with CLP(FD)

See Getting Started for installation and the REPL, then work through Prolog Basics before visiting CLP(FD).

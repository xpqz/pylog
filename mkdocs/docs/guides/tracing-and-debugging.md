# Tracing and debugging

Keep queries small and add goals one by one. Check intermediate domains with diagnostic predicates if available.

Ideas:

- break problems into predicates and test each in isolation
- inspect domains after posting constraints before labelling
- prefer declarative checks over printâ€‘style debugging

Tracing support evolves with the engine. Check release notes for updates.

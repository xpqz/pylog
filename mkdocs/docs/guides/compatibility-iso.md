# ISO compatibility

PyLog follows a useful subset of ISO Prolog. Differences exist in areas such as modules, I/O, and full numeric tower support. CLP(FD) adds nonâ€‘ISO operators with `#` prefixes.

If you rely on specific ISO features not covered here, check tests or open an issue with a small example.

# FAQ

Q: Do I need to label variables?

A: Yes. Constraints narrow domains. `label/1` assigns values.

Q: Are floats supported?

A: No. CLP(FD) is for integers. Use integer modelling.

Q: How do I get all answers?

A: The REPL enumerates all answers for a goal. In code, you can collect solutions by iterating.
